<p style="margin-top:20px;">
Before I ask you something important...
I just want to say sorry.
</p>

<p>
You deserve someone who asks you early,
someone who plans ahead for you,
not someone asking on the day itself.
</p>

<p>
But even if this is today,
my feelings were never last minute.
They’ve been real.
They’ve been growing.
</p>

<p>
I’m sorry if this is late, love.
But my heart has always been on time for you.
