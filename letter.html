<h1>To My Love 💕</h1>

<div class="container">
    <p>
        Love, you have no idea how much you changed my life.
        You became my peace in chaos, my comfort on heavy days,
        and the reason why I smile randomly.
    </p>

    <p>
        Every moment with you feels warm.
        Even silence with you feels safe.
    </p>

    <p>
        I don’t just like you…
        I choose you. Every single day.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thank you for being my love.
    </p>
